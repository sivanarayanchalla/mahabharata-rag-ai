Approaching the army of Dhritarashtra's son, those (warriors) invincible in battle[2] stationed themselves with their troops on the western part (of the plain), their faces turned towards the east. Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, caused tents by thousands to be set up according to rule, beyond the region called Samantapanchaka.
